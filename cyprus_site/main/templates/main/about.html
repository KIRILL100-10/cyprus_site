        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
            This website is a personal project designed to share information in a simple and user-friendly way. 
            It was built as part of a learning journey in web development, with the goal of combining clean design, 
            responsive layouts, and practical functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project demonstrates how templates, CSS styling, and basic navigation can be used to build 
            a structured website. It also shows how content can be organized into sections such as a homepage, 
            highlights, and detailed pages.
